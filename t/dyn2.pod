The following variables can be set in this section:

=over

=item B<a>

This variable I<dynamically> modifies the grammar based on its value.

=back

=head2 *** test ***

The following sections are valid on level 1:

=over

=item B<+/s+/>

The grammar of this section is I<dynamically> modified based on its name.

The following variables can be set in this section:

=over

=item B<a>

=item B<b>

=item B<c>

=back

Dynamical grammar changes for example instances of this section:

=over

=item B<s>: Less than three 's' letters have no effect

No changes that can be automatically described.

(End of dynamical grammar changes for example instance C<s>.)

=item B<ss>: Less than three 's' letters still have no effect

No changes that can be automatically described.

(End of dynamical grammar changes for example instance C<ss>.)

=item B<sss>: More than two 's' letters do have an effect

The following variables are not valid anymore:

=over

=item c

=back

(End of dynamical grammar changes for example instance C<sss>.)

=back

(End of dynamical grammar changes for example instances of section C</s+/>.)

=back

Dynamical grammar changes for example values of variable C<a>:

=over

=item B<1>: Values other than 2 have no effect

No changes that can be automatically described.

(End of dynamical grammar changes for variable C<a> example value C<1>.)

=item B<2>: This creates new variables 'b' and 'c'

The following new variables are valid:

=over

=item B<b>

=item B<c>

Default value: c = 5

=back

(End of dynamical grammar changes for variable C<a> example value C<2>.)

=back

(End of dynamical grammar changes for example values of variable C<a>.)
